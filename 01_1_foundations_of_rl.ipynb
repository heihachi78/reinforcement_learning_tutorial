    "# 1. What is Reinforcement Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an **agent** learns to make decisions by interacting with an **environment**. Unlike supervised learning (where we have labeled data) or unsupervised learning (where we find patterns in data), RL learns from **trial and error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics of RL\n",
    "\n",
    "RL has several unique characteristics that distinguish it from other machine learning paradigms:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Characteristic | Description | FrozenLake Example |\n",
    "|---------------|-------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| **No supervisor** | There's no teacher telling the agent what the correct action is. Instead, there's only a reward signal indicating how good or bad an action was. | The agent isn't told \"go RIGHT here\" or \"avoid this path.\" It only receives +1 for reaching the Goal and 0 otherwise. It must discover the correct path through trial and error. |\n",
    "| **Delayed feedback** | The reward may come much later after the action was taken. A chess move might only prove good or bad many moves later. | The agent receives reward only at the end of an episode (reaching Goal or falling into a Hole). All intermediate moves on frozen tiles give 0 reward, so the agent doesn't know if early moves were good until much later. |\n",
    "| **Sequential data** | Data is not i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed). Current observations depend on previous actions. | The state the agent sees depends entirely on its previous actions. Being in state 6 means the agent took a specific sequence of moves from the start. Each observation is a direct consequence of prior decisions. |\n",
    "| **Actions affect future** | The agent's actions influence the data it will receive in the future. This creates a feedback loop. | Moving DOWN from state 0 leads to states 4 or below, while moving RIGHT leads to states 1 or to the right. The agent's choice determines which parts of the grid it will experience and whether it encounters Holes or the Goal. |\n",

The Reward Signal\n\nThe **reward** $R_t$ is a scalar feedback signal that indicates how well the agent is doing at time step $t$.\n\nThe agent's goal is to **maximize the cumulative reward** over time, not just the immediate reward.\n\n$$\\text{Goal: Maximize } \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} R_t$$\n\n### The Reward Signal in FrozenLake\n\nIn the FrozenLake environment, the reward structure is simple but instructive:\n\n| Event | Reward | Meaning |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| Step on Frozen tile (F) | 0 | No immediate feedback - the agent doesn't know if it's on the right path |\n| Fall into Hole (H) | 0 | Episode ends with no reward - the agent failed |\n| Reach Goal (G) | +1 | Episode ends successfully - this is the only positive signal |\n\nThis **sparse reward** structure makes learning challenging:\n- The agent receives the same reward (0) for safe moves and falling into holes\n- Only reaching the Goal provides a positive signal\n- The agent must learn to associate earlier actions with the eventual outcome\n\n### How Can the Agent Maximize Reward in FrozenLake?\n\nSince the only positive reward (+1) comes from reaching the Goal, the agent maximizes cumulative reward by:\n\n1. **Finding paths that lead to the Goal** - The agent must discover which sequences of actions successfully navigate from S to G\n\n2. **Avoiding Holes** - Falling into a Hole ends the episode with 0 total reward, so the agent must learn to steer away from H tiles\n\n3. **Handling the slippery ice** - Since the ice is slippery, the intended action only succeeds 1/3 of the time. The other 2/3 of the time, the agent slips perpendicular to the intended direction. The agent must learn policies that are robust to this stochasticity (e.g., staying away from Holes even when \"pushed\" by the slippery ice)\n\n4. **Reaching the Goal quickly (with discounting)** - When using a discount factor $\\gamma < 1$, reaching the Goal sooner yields a higher present value. A reward of +1 received after 5 steps is worth $\\gamma^5$, while +1 after 10 steps is worth only $\\gamma^{10}$\n\n### The Reward Hypothesis\n\n> **\"All goals can be described as the maximization of expected cumulative reward.\"**\n\nThis is a foundational assumption in RL. While powerful, it's also debated:\n\n**Arguments for:**\n- Many complex behaviors can indeed be expressed as reward maximization\n- It provides a unified framework for decision-making\n\n**Arguments against:**\n- Some goals (curiosity, creativity, ethics) are hard to quantify as a single scalar\n- Designing the right reward function (reward shaping) is often very challenging\n\n> **Checkpoint — You should now understand:**\n> - What the reward signal is and how it guides learning\n> - Why FrozenLake's sparse reward structure makes learning challenging\n> - The reward hypothesis and its implications"

   "source": "---\n# 4. Sequential Decision Making\n\nThe goal of sequential decision making is to select actions that **maximize total future reward**.\n\nKey insight: Actions may have **long-term consequences**, and rewards may be **delayed**. Sometimes it's better to sacrifice immediate reward for greater long-term gain.\n\n### Examples:\n\n1. **Financial investment**: You invest money today (losing immediate spending power) for returns months or years later.\n\n2. **Helicopter refueling**: Refueling now (taking time away from the mission) prevents crashes hours later.\n\n3. **Chess**: Sacrificing a piece now might lead to checkmate many moves later.\n\n4. **Education**: Studying hard now (foregoing leisure) leads to better career opportunities later.\n\n### Sequential Decision Making in FrozenLake\n\nFrozenLake is a perfect example of sequential decision making. Let's break down why:\n\n#### Why is it Sequential?\n\nEach decision depends on where you are, and where you are depends on all previous decisions:\n\n```\nStep 1: At S (state 0) → Choose DOWN → Move to state 4\nStep 2: At state 4 → Choose DOWN → Move to state 8\nStep 3: At state 8 → Choose RIGHT → Move to state 9\n...and so on until reaching G or falling into H\n```\n\nThe agent cannot jump directly to the Goal - it must navigate through a **sequence of states**, and each action opens or closes future possibilities.\n\n#### Trade-offs in FrozenLake\n\n| Sacrifice | Short-term Cost | Long-term Benefit |\n|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| **Taking a longer path** | More steps, lower discounted reward | Avoids Holes, higher probability of reaching Goal |\n| **Moving away from Goal temporarily** | Increases distance to reward | May avoid a dangerous Hole in the direct path |\n| **Staying near edges** | Limits movement options | Reduces risk of slipping into Holes |\n\n#### A Concrete Example: The Greedy Trap\n\n```\nGrid layout (4x4):\nS  F  F  F      States: 0  1  2  3\nF  H  F  H              4  5  6  7\nF  F  F  H              8  9  10 11\nH  F  F  G              12 13 14 15\n```\n\n**Greedy approach** (always move toward Goal):\n- From state 0: Go RIGHT and DOWN as directly as possible toward state 15\n- Problem: This path goes through states 5, 7, or 11 - all Holes!\n\n**Sequential thinking approach**:\n- From state 0: Go DOWN first (states 0→4→8), then navigate around Holes\n- The path S→4→8→9→10→14→15 avoids all Holes\n- Even though going DOWN initially moves \"sideways\" relative to the Goal, it's the winning strategy\n\n#### The Key Insight\n\nIn FrozenLake, the agent must learn that:\n- **Immediate progress toward the Goal can be fatal** (Holes block direct paths)\n- **Seemingly suboptimal moves may be necessary** (going around Holes)\n- **The slippery ice adds uncertainty** - even \"safe\" moves might slip into danger (recall that intended actions only succeed 1/3 of the time)\n- **Every decision shapes future options** - one wrong move can make the Goal unreachable\n\nThis is the essence of sequential decision making: **optimize for the cumulative outcome, not each individual step**.\n\n> **Checkpoint — You should now understand:**\n> - Why actions have long-term consequences\n> - The difference between greedy and strategic decision making\n> - Why the \"obvious\" path in FrozenLake is often wrong"

It doesn't matter how we got there - only the current position matters for determining the best move.\n\n**Not Markov:** In poker with hidden cards, just knowing the visible cards isn't Markov - the history of betting might give information about hidden cards.\n\n### Why is FrozenLake Markov?\n\nFrozenLake is a perfect example of a Markov environment. Here's why:\n\n#### The State Contains All Relevant Information\n\nIn FrozenLake, the state is simply the agent's position (0-15). This single number tells us everything we need to know:\n\n| What We Know from State | Why It's Sufficient |\n|------------------------|---------------------|\n| Current position on grid | Determines available actions and their outcomes |\n| Distance to Goal | Implicit in position (state 15 is Goal) |\n| Nearby Holes | Grid layout is fixed, so position reveals dangers |\n| Possible next states | Transition probabilities depend only on current position |\n\n#### The History Doesn't Matter\n\nConsider two different histories that both end in **state 10**:\n\n```\nHistory A: 0 → 4 → 8 → 9 → 10  (came from the left)\nHistory B: 0 → 1 → 2 → 6 → 10  (came from above)\n```\n\n**Key insight:** Once the agent is in state 10, the future is identical regardless of how it got there:\n- Same actions available (LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, UP)\n- Same transition probabilities (1/3 chance each direction due to slippery ice)\n- Same possible next states (6, 9, 11, 14)\n- Same reward structure (0 for moves, +1 only at Goal)\n\nThe path taken to reach state 10 provides **zero additional information** about what will happen next.\n\n#### Why This Matters\n\nBecause FrozenLake is Markov:\n1. **Simple state representation** - We only need to track current position, not the entire history\n2. **Efficient learning** - The agent can learn values for 16 states instead of infinitely many histories\n3. **Optimal policies exist** - We can find a policy that maps states to actions without considering history\n4. **Dynamic programming works** - Bellman equations (covered later) rely on the Markov property\n\n> **Checkpoint — You should now understand:**\n> - What the Markov property means: \"the future is independent of the past, given the present\"\n> - Why FrozenLake satisfies the Markov property\n> - Why the Markov property makes RL problems tractable"

Your Turn\n\nNow it's time to test your understanding with some exercises!\n\n## Exercise 1: Conceptual Question\n\nConsider a modified FrozenLake environment where:\n- Each frozen tile (F) can only be stepped on 3 times before it breaks and becomes a hole\n- The environment tracks how many times each tile has been visited\n\n**Question:** Would this modified environment still satisfy the Markov property if we only observe the agent's position (0-15)? Why or why not?\n\n*Think about your answer before looking at the hint below.*\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to see hint</summary>\n\nThink about what information would be missing if we only know the current position. Does the history of where we've been affect what happens next?\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to see answer</summary>\n\n**No, it would NOT be Markov with just the position.** \n\nIn the modified environment, knowing only the current position isn't enough - we also need to know how many times each tile has been visited. Two agents at the same position might face different outcomes: one might be standing on a tile that's about to break, while the other is on a fresh tile.\n\nTo make it Markov, we'd need to expand the state to include visit counts for all tiles, e.g., `(position, visit_count_tile_0, visit_count_tile_1, ...)`.\n\n</details>\n\n## Exercise 2: Code Task\n\nModify the code below to run an episode and count:\n1. How many times the agent slipped (moved in an unintended direction)\n2. The total number of steps taken\n\nThen calculate the \"slip rate\" (slips / total steps)."
